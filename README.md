# Newton-Rapson-In-C
Newton-Raphson method, also known as the Newton’s Method, is the simplest and fastest approach to find the root of a function. It is an open bracket method and requires only one initial guess. The C program for Newton Raphson method presented here is a programming approach which can be used to find the real roots of not only a nonlinear function, but also those of algebraic and transcendental equations.  Newton’s method is often used to improve the result or value of the root obtained from other methods. This method is more useful when the first derivative of f(x) is a large value.
